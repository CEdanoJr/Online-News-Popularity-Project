Make use of a largely and recently collected dataset with over 39,000 articles from Mashable website, to first select informative features and then analyze and compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms. Specifically, it aims to:
1. Use different Machine Learning models such as KNN, CART, C5.0, and Random Forest models to predict and evaluate the popularity of online news.
2. Select informative features and then analyze and compare the performance of each models.
3. Individually make a sensitivity and specificity graph for each model.
4. Make a true positive rate and false positive rate graph for each model.
